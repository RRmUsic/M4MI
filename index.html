<h2>A1</h2>
<p> For A1 I have chosed the 4th poem. I took this one because I felt it's the most inspiring for me. Somehow I associated the poem with the sound of a guitar, so I decided to stick just to one instrument, instead of using a lot of vst, effects etc. </p>

I figured to create myself an "erasing" sample,used at the beggining of the video, by scrathing a notebook using the same movement from the piece. I have tried to emphasize the main idea of the video, by using the heart beat sample to create a connection between the two characters. </p>

<p> I had a lot of fun creating the audio for the card game because I created most of the samples found in the piece. The video made me think of something medieval, "Lord of the rings" type of thing. The
