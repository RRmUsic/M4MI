<h2>A1</h2>
<p> For A1 I have chosed the 4th poem. I took this one because I felt it's the most inspiring for me. Somehow I associated the poem with the sound of a guitar, so I decided to stick just to one instrument, instead of using a lot of vst, effects etc. </p>

<h2>A2</h2>
<p> When I first started working on this particular assessment, I didn't know what exactly to compose, because all the videos were almost the same and they weren't transmiting me anything. Then I decided to take the first one because it was the most colourfull. I have managed to put everything together and finnish the song. For this assessment I have used free copyright samples from freesound.org. I tried to create a nostalgic and dreamy feeling. I think that the samples with the children in context with the song creates the idea of childhood.</p>
