<h2>A1</h2>
<p> For A1 I have chosed the 4th poem. I took this one because I felt it's the most inspiring for me. Somehow I associated the poem with the sound of a guitar, so I decided to stick just to one instrument, instead of using a lot of vst, effects etc. However, I have used some reverb to create space in the song and an equalizer to remove some of the frequencies. </p>

<p> In this song I have used samples from freesound.org which is a free copyright samples site. I took the first video because it was the most colourful. Speaking of the background of the song, I wanted to create the idea of childhood so I chosed some samples with children speaking or playing. These samples with the piano together create that nostalgic and dreamy feeling. The video made me think of evolution and so I tried to emphasize the movement of the subject by using a white noise with an automation clip. Also, i added a cracking sound when the subject was making sudden movements.  </p>

<p> I took the "Erased" video because I felt it was the most emotional one. I tried to create a simple sound, by using just a virtual instrument called "Dream" and adding some little details to create the connection between the sound and the video. In this video I have also used samples from the same site, freesound.org. I added samples like screaming in the tension part of the video so I can create the idea of pain and fear. I figured to create myself an "erasing" sample, used at the beggining of the video, by scrathing a notebook using the same movement from the piece. I have tried to emphasize the main idea of the video, by using the heart beat sample to create a connection between the two characters. </p>

<p> I had a lot of fun creating the audio for the card game because I created most of the samples found in the piece. For the sounds of: placing the cards on the table, taking the cards from the deck and destroying the cards I have used my voice and for the attack sound I have hitted two knives. The video made me think of something medieval, "Lord of the rings" type of thing so I have used strings for the melody and the chords. The pizzicato is used to sustain the main chords but in the same time make a slight change of the arrangement so it can keep the listener's attention. I have set the volume of the music lower than the gameplay effects to create the idea of someone playing the game. I changed the music at the end of the video to highlight the victory of the player. </p>
